# Explanation Frameworks & Teaching Techniques

Use these frameworks and techniques to create clear, effective technical explanations that promote deep understanding.

## Explanation Models

### ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five)
- Use simple language and familiar analogies
- Break complex ideas into fundamental components
- Connect to everyday experiences and objects
- Focus on key concepts without overwhelming detail
- Use concrete examples rather than abstractions

### The Feynman Technique
1. Identify the concept to explain
2. Explain it in simple terms as if teaching a novice
3. Identify gaps in your explanation where you resort to jargon
4. Review and simplify further, using analogies to bridge gaps
5. Test your explanation on the intended audience

### Conceptual-Procedural Framework
- **Conceptual knowledge**: The "what" and "why" (principles, theories)
- **Procedural knowledge**: The "how" (steps, processes, implementations)
- Balance both types of knowledge in explanations
- Establish conceptual foundations before procedural details
- Connect procedures back to underlying concepts

### Scaffolded Learning
- Start with what the user likely knows
- Incrementally introduce new concepts
- Provide support that can be gradually removed
- Build complexity through layered understanding
- Create connections between existing and new knowledge

## Teaching Strategies

### Multiple Representations
Present key ideas in different formats:
- Textual explanations
- Visual diagrams and models
- Code examples
- Mathematical notation (when appropriate)
- Analogies and metaphors
- Interactive examples

### Chunking Information
- Group related concepts together
- Present 3-5 key points at a time
- Use clear headings and structure
- Create logical bridges between chunks
- Summarize each chunk before moving to the next

### Concrete to Abstract Progression
1. Start with specific, concrete examples
2. Identify patterns across examples
3. Introduce abstract principles that explain the patterns
4. Apply abstractions to new concrete situations
5. Discuss limitations and edge cases

### Question-Based Learning
- Frame explanations around key questions
- Anticipate follow-up questions
- Use questions to highlight important concepts
- Encourage analytical thinking
- Structure explanations as answers to natural questions

## Communication Techniques

### Active/Passive Voice Balance
- Use active voice for clarity in procedures and actions
- Use passive voice when focusing on concepts or results rather than actors
- Maintain consistent voice within sections
- Choose voice based on what should be emphasized

### Technical Vocabulary Management
- Define terms before using them
- Use consistent terminology throughout explanations
- Create mini-glossaries for complex topics
- Balance technical precision with accessibility
- Scale terminology to user's apparent expertise level

### Layered Complexity
- Provide initial simple explanations
- Add nuance and complexity in subsequent layers
- Clearly signal transitions between complexity levels
- Allow the user to control depth of explanation
- Keep core message clear regardless of detail level

### Cognitive Load Management
- Focus on one main concept at a time
- Remove extraneous information
- Use consistent patterns and frameworks
- Provide rest points for processing (summaries, checkpoints)
- Balance completeness with cognitive capacity

## Effective Examples

### Example Selection Criteria
- Relevance to the user's context
- Simplicity while maintaining authenticity
- Memorability and distinctiveness
- Coverage of important variations
- Highlighting of key principles

### Code Example Best Practices
- Keep examples minimal yet complete
- Include comments explaining key sections
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Progress from simple to more complex examples
- Highlight patterns that can be generalized

### Anti-patterns and Pitfalls
- Include common mistakes and misconceptions
- Explain why anti-patterns are problematic
- Demonstrate refactoring from problematic to better approaches
- Discuss symptoms that indicate presence of anti-patterns
- Connect anti-patterns to underlying principles
