# Architectural Documentation & Design

Effective architectural documentation communicates design intent, supports decision-making, and provides a blueprint for implementation. Follow these guidelines for creating valuable design documentation:

## Architectural Views

Organize your documentation around these complementary views:

### Context View
- Shows the system's relationship with external entities and users
- Defines the system boundaries and key integration points
- Identifies external dependencies and constraints
- Uses context diagrams to visualize the system's place in its environment

### Functional View
- Describes the system's functional elements and their responsibilities
- Outlines key use cases and functional requirements
- Maps business capabilities to system components
- Uses component diagrams and capability maps

### Information View
- Defines the data model and information flow
- Documents entity relationships and data structures
- Specifies data ownership and consistency requirements
- Uses entity-relationship diagrams and data flow diagrams

### Deployment View
- Shows the physical or virtual infrastructure
- Defines runtime components and their deployment targets
- Specifies hardware requirements and network topology
- Uses deployment diagrams and infrastructure schematics

### Development View
- Describes the system from a developer's perspective
- Outlines module organization and code structure
- Defines development standards and practices
- Uses package diagrams and module dependency graphs

## Documentation Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
- Focus on architecturally significant elements
- Document the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- Highlight risks, constraints, and assumptions
- Include considered alternatives and reasons for rejection
- Maintain appropriate detail level (avoid excessive documentation)

### Format & Structure
- Use a consistent template across documents
- Start with an executive summary for each document
- Use diagrams extensively with supporting text
- Include a glossary for domain-specific terminology
- Organize information hierarchically (from high-level to detailed)

### Diagram Guidelines
- Follow standard notation (UML, C4 Model, etc.) consistently
- Keep diagrams focused on a single concern
- Include legends for custom notations
- Use colors and shapes consistently
- Create diagrams at different abstraction levels

## Mermaid Diagram Examples

When visualizing architecture, use Mermaid diagrams like these:

### Component Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    UI[Web UI] --> |HTTP/REST| API[API Gateway]
    API --> |calls| Auth[Auth Service]
    API --> |calls| Orders[Order Service]
    API --> |calls| Catalog[Catalog Service]
    Orders --> |reads/writes| OrderDB[(Order Database)]
    Catalog --> |reads/writes| ProductDB[(Product Database)]
    Auth --> |reads| UserDB[(User Database)]
```

### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant W as Web App
    participant A as API
    participant DB as Database
    
    U->>W: Submit Order
    W->>A: POST /orders
    A->>A: Validate Order
    A->>DB: Store Order
    DB-->>A: Confirmation
    A-->>W: Order ID
    W-->>U: Order Confirmation
```

### Class/Entity Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    Customer "1" --> "*" Order
    Order "*" --> "*" Product
    Order --> OrderStatus
    
    class Customer {
        +String id
        +String name
        +String email
        +getOrders()
    }
    
    class Order {
        +String id
        +Date createdAt
        +Number total
        +OrderStatus status
        +addProduct()
        +removeProduct()
    }
    
    class Product {
        +String id
        +String name
        +Number price
        +Number inventory
    }
    
    class OrderStatus {
        <<enumeration>>
        CREATED
        PAID
        SHIPPED
        DELIVERED
        CANCELLED
    }
```

### State Diagram
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created
    Created --> Processing: payment_received
    Processing --> Shipped: items_packed
    Shipped --> Delivered: delivery_confirmed
    Created --> Cancelled: cancel_order
    Processing --> Cancelled: cancel_order
    Shipped --> Returned: return_initiated
    Delivered --> Returned: return_initiated
```
