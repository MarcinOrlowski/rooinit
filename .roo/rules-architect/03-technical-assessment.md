# Technical Assessment & Decision Making

Effective software architecture requires methodical assessment, informed decision-making, and systematic evaluation of alternatives. Use these frameworks and approaches to guide your architectural decisions.

## Requirement Analysis

### Functional Requirements Assessment
- Identify core business capabilities and use cases
- Determine criticality and priority of features
- Analyze workflows and business processes
- Map dependencies between functional areas

### Quality Attributes Assessment
- Define and prioritize quality attributes:
  - Performance (response time, throughput, latency)
  - Scalability (vertical, horizontal, load distribution)
  - Security (authentication, authorization, data protection)
  - Reliability (availability, fault tolerance, recoverability)
  - Maintainability (modularity, testability, understandability)
  - Usability (accessibility, learnability, efficiency)
- Create quality attribute scenarios to make requirements concrete
- Establish measurable criteria for each attribute

### Constraint Analysis
- Identify technical constraints (languages, platforms, integrations)
- Define operational constraints (deployment, monitoring, support)
- Consider organizational constraints (skills, resources, timeline)
- Recognize business constraints (budget, licensing, compliance)

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

Document key architectural decisions using this structured format:

### ADR Template
```
# Title: [Brief Decision Description]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated | Rejected]

## Context
[Decision context, problem being solved, and relevant constraints]

## Decision
[The decision made, stated clearly and concisely]

## Consequences
[Positive, negative, and neutral consequences of the decision]

## Alternatives Considered
[Alternative options and why they were not chosen]

## Related Decisions
[References to related architectural decisions]
```

## Trade-off Analysis

### SWOT Analysis for Architectural Options
- **Strengths**: Technical advantages, alignment with requirements
- **Weaknesses**: Technical limitations, complexity, risks
- **Opportunities**: Future extensibility, emerging technologies
- **Threats**: Vendor lock-in, obsolescence, scaling challenges

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Implementation costs (development effort, licensing)
- Operational costs (hosting, maintenance, support)
- Business benefits (revenue, efficiency, user satisfaction)
- Technical benefits (performance, maintainability, security)

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix
- Identify potential architectural risks
- Rate each risk by:
  - Probability (likelihood of occurrence)
  - Impact (severity if it occurs)
  - Detectability (ease of early detection)
- Calculate risk priority score
- Develop mitigation strategies for high-priority risks

### Risk Categories
- **Technical Risk**: Unproven technology, complex integration
- **Schedule Risk**: Tight deadlines, dependencies on external factors
- **Resource Risk**: Limited expertise, team availability
- **Operational Risk**: Deployment, monitoring, maintenance challenges
- **Business Risk**: Changing requirements, market conditions
- **Security Risk**: Vulnerabilities, compliance issues

## Proof of Concept Guidelines

When a solution requires validation through a proof of concept:

1. Define clear goals and success criteria
2. Focus on validating the riskiest aspects
3. Establish a time-boxed approach
4. Create minimal implementation to test key assumptions
5. Document findings objectively (both positive and negative)
6. Make clear recommendations based on results
