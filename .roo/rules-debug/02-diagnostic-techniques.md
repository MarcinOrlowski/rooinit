# Advanced Diagnostic Techniques

These specialized techniques help diagnose different types of software issues effectively.

## Effective Logging

### Logging Levels
- **ERROR**: Unexpected failures requiring immediate attention
- **WARNING**: Potential issues that don't prevent execution
- **INFO**: Normal but significant events
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for troubleshooting

### Strategic Logging Placement
- Entry/exit of key functions with parameters and return values
- Before/after critical operations or state changes
- Around external system interactions
- At decision points with condition values
- When handling exceptional cases

### Effective Log Content
- Include timestamps and execution context
- Log relevant variable values and types
- Use consistent formatting for easier parsing
- Include correlation IDs for tracking requests
- Avoid logging sensitive information

## Memory Issue Diagnosis

### Signs of Memory Problems
- Increasing memory usage over time
- Out of memory errors
- Performance degradation after extended use
- Unexplained crashes or stability issues

### Diagnosis Techniques
- Generate heap dumps for analysis
- Track object creation and destruction
- Add weak references to monitor garbage collection
- Implement leak detection with counters or generation tracking
- Use memory profiling tools specific to the language/runtime

## Performance Debugging

### Performance Problem Categories
- CPU-bound issues (algorithms, computation)
- I/O-bound issues (disk, network, database)
- Memory-bound issues (excessive allocation, GC pressure)
- Locking/contention issues (synchronization overhead)

### Profiling Approaches
- Sampling profilers to identify hot spots
- Instrumentation profilers for detailed timing
- Targeted microbenchmarks for specific operations
- Event timing with high-precision timestamps
- Flame graphs for visualizing performance bottlenecks

### Performance Analysis
- Identify critical paths in execution
- Look for N+1 query patterns
- Check for unnecessary work or computations
- Evaluate caching opportunities
- Examine resource utilization patterns

## Concurrency Bug Detection

### Types of Concurrency Bugs
- Race conditions (non-deterministic behavior based on timing)
- Deadlocks (circular waiting for resources)
- Livelocks (threads actively prevent progress)
- Starvation (threads unable to get resources)
- Atomicity violations (interrupted operations)

### Detection Techniques
- Thread dumps and analysis
- Intentional delays to expose race conditions
- Stress testing with high concurrency
- Instrumenting synchronization points
- Generating execution history and thread interaction diagrams

## Network & Integration Debugging

### Diagnostic Approaches
- API request/response logging with full headers and bodies
- Network packet capture and analysis
- Service dependency mapping
- Latency tracking between components
- Mock external dependencies for isolation testing

### Common Integration Failure Points
- Authentication and authorization
- Data format mismatches
- API versioning issues
- Timeout configurations
- Retry and backoff strategies

## Debugging Tools & Utilities

### General-Purpose Tools
