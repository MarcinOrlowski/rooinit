# Common Bug Patterns & Solutions

Understanding typical bug patterns helps in faster diagnosis and resolution. Here are common categories of bugs with their symptoms, causes, and solutions.

## Data Handling Bugs

### Null/Undefined Reference Errors
- **Symptoms**: NullPointerException, TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined
- **Causes**: Missing null checks, assumptions about data presence
- **Solutions**:
  - Add defensive null checks before accessing properties
  - Use null coalescing or optional chaining operators
  - Validate data early in the execution path
  - Consider using Option/Maybe types where available

### Input Validation Issues
- **Symptoms**: Unexpected behavior with certain inputs, security vulnerabilities
- **Causes**: Missing or insufficient validation, incorrect assumptions about input format
- **Solutions**:
  - Implement thorough validation at system boundaries
  - Use schema validation libraries for complex structures
  - Add constraints enforcement and normalization
  - Apply the principle of least privilege to data access

### Type Conversion Problems
- **Symptoms**: Data corruption, incorrect calculations, display issues
- **Causes**: Implicit type conversions, parsing errors, encoding issues
- **Solutions**:
  - Use explicit type conversions
  - Add type checking and validation
  - Consider strongly typed interfaces or static typing
  - Handle encoding consistently (especially for text)

## Logic and Control Flow Bugs

### Off-By-One Errors
- **Symptoms**: Arrays indexed incorrectly, loops running too many/few times
- **Causes**: Confusion between zero/one-based indexing, inclusive/exclusive ranges
- **Solutions**:
  - Use inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound convention consistently
  - Use iterator methods rather than manual indexing when possible
  - Add bounds checking and assertions
  - Write test cases specifically for boundary conditions

### State Management Issues
- **Symptoms**: Inconsistent application state, unexpected side effects
- **Causes**: Unclear ownership of state, mutation in multiple places
- **Solutions**:
  - Centralize state management
  - Make state changes explicit and traceable
  - Use immutable data structures where appropriate
  - Implement state machines for complex workflows

### Race Conditions
- **Symptoms**: Intermittent failures, timing-dependent bugs
- **Causes**: Unsynchronized access to shared resources, assumption of operation order
- **Solutions**:
  - Use proper synchronization mechanisms
  - Implement atomic operations
  - Design for thread-safety from the start
  - Minimize shared mutable state

## Resource Management Bugs

### Memory Leaks
- **Symptoms**: Increasing memory usage, degraded performance over time
- **Causes**: Unclosed resources, retained references preventing garbage collection
- **Solutions**:
  - Ensure proper resource cleanup (close() calls, try-with-resources)
  - Remove references to unused objects
  - Use weak references for caches and observers
  - Implement disposal patterns for long-lived objects

### File Handling Errors
- **Symptoms**: "Too many open files" errors, locked files
- **Causes**: Unclosed file handles, missing try/finally blocks
- **Solutions**:
  - Always close files in finally blocks or use language-specific resource management
  - Use try-with-resources or equivalent patterns
  - Implement file operation timeouts
  - Add proper error handling for I/O operations

### Connection Pool Exhaustion
- **Symptoms**: Timeouts, connection refused errors
- **Causes**: Leaking connections, improper pooling configuration
- **Solutions**:
  - Ensure connections are always returned to the pool
  - Configure appropriate pool sizes and timeout settings
  - Implement connection health checks
  - Add monitoring for pool utilization

## Asynchronous Code Bugs

### Promise/Callback Hell
- **Symptoms**: Complex, nested, unreadable async code
- **Causes**: Chained callbacks, improper async pattern usage
- **Solutions**:
  - Use async/await or equivalent patterns
  - Implement proper error handling for async operations
  - Break complex operations into smaller, named functions
  - Consider reactive programming for complex event flows

### Unhandled Exceptions in Async Code
- **Symptoms**: Silent failures, "Unhandled promise rejection" warnings
- **Causes**: Missing try/catch blocks, improper error propagation
- **Solutions**:
  - Add proper error handling to all async operations
  - Use global unhandled rejection handlers as a safety net
  - Implement retry logic for transient failures
  - Add logging for async errors

## Integration Bugs

### API Contract Violations
- **Symptoms**: Unexpected 4xx/5xx responses, data mismatches
- **Causes**: Misunderstanding API requirements, undocumented changes
- **Solutions**:
  - Validate API requests/responses against schemas
  - Add integration tests for critical API interactions
  - Implement API versioning strategy
  - Use client libraries generated from API specifications

### Configuration Mismatches
- **Symptoms**: Component initialization failures, connection errors
- **Causes**: Inconsistent configuration across environments, typos in config keys
- **Solutions**:
  - Validate configurations at startup
  - Use strong typing for configuration objects
  - Implement centralized configuration management
  - Add config validation tests

## Performance Bugs

### N+1 Query Problems
- **Symptoms**: Excessive database queries, poor performance with larger datasets
- **Causes**: Loading related data in loops instead of bulk operations
- **Solutions**:
  - Use eager loading / join queries where appropriate
  - Implement batched loading for related entities
  - Add caching for frequently accessed data
  - Use query profiling to identify inefficient patterns

### Memory-Intensive Operations
- **Symptoms**: Out of memory errors, excessive garbage collection
- **Causes**: Loading too much data at once, inefficient algorithms
- **Solutions**:
  - Implement pagination and streaming for large datasets
  - Use more memory-efficient data structures
  - Consider time-space tradeoffs in algorithm selection
  - Profile memory usage to identify problematic areas
