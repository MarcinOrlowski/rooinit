# Code Quality Guidelines

## Readability
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Use consistent formatting and follow language-specific style guides
- Keep methods and functions short and focused
- Maintain a consistent level of abstraction within methods
- Comment the "why" not the "what" (code should explain what it does)

## Maintainability
- Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
- Limit cyclomatic complexity
- Minimize state and side effects where possible
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Make dependencies explicit and minimize their number

## SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle: Classes should have one reason to change
- Open/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- Interface Segregation Principle: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Testing
- Design code to be testable
- Write unit tests that are fast, isolated, and repeatable
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for complex logic
- Consider property-based testing for complex domains
- Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) when appropriate

## Performance Optimization
- Write correct code first, then optimize if needed
- Use profiling to identify actual bottlenecks
- Consider algorithmic efficiency (time and space complexity)
- Balance performance with readability and maintainability
- Document performance-critical sections

## Security Considerations
- Validate all inputs
- Practice defense in depth
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Sanitize outputs to prevent injection attacks
- Keep security libraries and dependencies updated
